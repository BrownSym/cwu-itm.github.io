            <h3>Defining Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>The purpose of systems thinking is to analyze data collected for any systems engineering project being facilitated. This is done by identifying the system’s attributes, concepts, constraints, stakeholders, and needs. By examining how these elements interact rather than treating them independently, systems thinking enables engineers to better understand overall system behavior and performance. As stated in the reading from the text, “Fundamentally, there are three types of causes for failures: communication, complexity, and understanding” (Holt, 2021). These causes are especially prevalent in large-scale or digital systems where multiple subsystems, teams, and technologies must work together seamlessly. Systems thinking aims to mitigate these failure drivers by promoting shared understanding, improving communication across disciplines, and managing complexity through holistic analysis. This is accomplished by ensuring consistency and alignment across every system concept, requirement, and attribute that is enabled throughout the lifecycle.</p>
            <p>In another article, Using Systems Thinking to Illustrate Digital Business Model Innovation, the authors state that “systems thinking is a transdisciplinary perspective which enables complex and multidimensional environmental, social, and organizational real-world situations to unfold and be tackled” (Kurti et al., 2021). This perspective is particularly valuable in modern systems engineering, where technical decisions are tightly coupled with organizational, operational, and user considerations. Monitoring all aspects of issues, projects, or plans, with the understanding that every part influences the whole, enables engineers to anticipate unintended consequences and emergent behaviors. As a result, systems thinking supports more robust decision-making, reduces integration risk, and enhances the likelihood that complex systems will meet stakeholder needs and perform as intended. Linear thinking tends to be more step-by-step, following a path to a solution, one component at a time. This kind of thinking is useful for smaller, less important issues that need a resolution. Systems thinking focuses more on how the issue is affecting the system as a whole and what changing it would look like across all aspects of the system. Traditional thinking might solve the problem and meet the basic requirements of an issue, but systems thinking offers a new perspective on the issue and meets the requirements while adding features that may have been identified in other areas of the system.</p>
            <h3>Traditional and Linear Thinking vs. Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>Linear thinking tends to be more step-by-step, following a direct path to a solution by addressing each component in turn. This kind of thinking is often effective for smaller, well-defined problems with limited interactions and straightforward resolution. In these cases, cause-and-effect relationships are usually clear, and changes made to one element have minimal impact on other parts of the system. Because of this, linear thinking is commonly used in traditional engineering tasks where requirements are stable, and the scope of the problem is narrow.</p>
            <p>Systems thinking, on the other hand, focuses on how an issue affects the system as a whole and how changes to one element influence other components, processes, and stakeholders. Rather than isolating a single problem, systems thinking examines interdependencies, feedback loops, and potential ripple effects across the entire system. While traditional thinking may successfully solve an immediate problem and meet basic requirements, it can overlook secondary impacts that emerge during integration or operation. Systems thinking offers a broader perspective by identifying these hidden interactions and addressing them early in the design process. This approach not only meets the original requirements but also enables the identification of additional needs, risks, or opportunities in other areas of the system. As a result, systems thinking supports more robust, adaptable, and sustainable solutions, particularly in complex systems where long-term performance and reliability are critical.</p>
            <h3>Model-Based Approaches for Digital Systems</h3>
            <p>A model-based approach is effective for digital systems because it provides a structured set of tools and techniques that support system development from concept through deployment and sustainment. This approach enables engineers to create visual and analytical representations of system requirements, architecture, behavior, and interfaces, allowing complex information to be understood and communicated more clearly. By using models as the primary source of information, teams can rigorously manage the various complexities inherent in digital systems, including software–hardware interactions, data flows, cybersecurity considerations, and performance constraints. Additionally, a model-based approach supports the identification and management of interdependencies and changes that may occur throughout the system’s life cycle, making it easier to assess the impacts of design decisions before implementation.</p>
            <p>The article Optimizing early-stage efficiency in complex system development via model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and concurrent engineering (CE) integration emphasizes that a model-based approach improves the management of complexity, enhances design integration, and reduces risk in complex engineered systems (Vizitiu et al., 2021). By enabling early analysis, simulation, and validation, MBSE helps uncover inconsistencies and design flaws before they become more costly to resolve. The benefits of using MBSE include efficiency gains, improved multidisciplinary collaboration, enhanced requirements traceability, reduced risk and error, and broader application across multiple domains. Together, these advantages make a model-based approach particularly well suited for modern digital systems, where complexity, change, and integration challenges are constant.</p>

<h1>Support User Thinking</h1>
<p>We use digital systems every day without really thinking about them. We scroll, click, type, and navigate through apps and websites almost automatically. However, when something does not work as we expect, we notice it immediately. Suddenly, we are confused, frustrated, or stuck. That moment of friction says a lot about usability.</p>
<p>After reading The Laws of UX by Jon Yablonski and Designing with the Mind in Mind by Jeff Johnson, I have realized that usability is not just about aesthetics or simplicity. It is about how well a system matches how our brains actually work—especially when it comes to memory, habits, and mental shortcuts.</p>
<p>Digital systems feel “usable” when they reduce cognitive effort, support our mental models, stay consistent, and provide clear feedback. When they do not, they create unnecessary cognitive load that makes even simple tasks feel harder than they should be.</p>
<h2>Memory Shape Online Engagement</h2>
<p>One of the prominent takeaways is how limited our working memory actually is. We like to think we can juggle a lot of information at once, but cognitive load theory shows that working memory has strict limits (Sweller, 1988). When too much information is thrown at us, our performance drops.</p>
<p>Johnson (2014) explains that interfaces should minimize memory burden because people can hold only a small amount of new information in their heads at a time. This really changed how I think about design. If a user has to remember instructions, hidden rules, or multiple steps while completing a task, the design is already asking a lot of the user.</p>
<p>A simple example I have experienced is creating passwords on websites. Some sites show all the password requirements up front. Others wait until you hit “submit” to tell you what you did wrong. In the second case, I have to remember which rules I missed when I try again. That extra mental effort might seem small, but it adds up. According to Sweller (1988), this kind of unnecessary mental effort is exactly what increases cognitive load and makes tasks feel frustrating. The most usable systems do not make you remember things that the interface could show you.</p>

<h2>Mental Models</h2>
<p>Another concept that stood out is mental models. A mental model is basically our internal idea of how something works. We build these models from experience. For example, I automatically expect a magnifying glass icon to mean “search” and a trash can to mean “delete.”</p>
<p>Johnson (2014) explains that users rely heavily on prior knowledge when interacting with new systems. That makes sense because none of us approaches a website with a completely blank mind. We bring expectations with us. When a system follows those expectations, it feels intuitive. However, when it breaks them, we hesitate. I have noticed this when websites add more navigation tools. Sometimes designers place menus in unexpected locations or use icons that are sometimes difficult for everyday users to understand. Usability improves when systems align with users' mental models rather than forcing them to rebuild them from scratch</p>
<h2>Recognition and Recall</h2>
<p>One of the most practical principles from Designing with the Mind in Mind is that recognition is easier than recall (Johnson, 2014). This seems straightforward, but it has huge implications for design. Recognition means seeing something and identifying it. Recall means I can pull information out of my memory without cues. Recall takes much more effort. Think about the difference between selecting an option from a dropdown menu and typing an exact command from memory. The dropdown supports recognition. The command requires recall.</p>
<p>When I use apps that autocomplete search results or show “recently viewed” items, I appreciate the ease of access they provide. I do not have to remember exact wording or previous steps. The system helps me. This connects directly to cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988). The more a system relies on recall, the more it strains working memory. Good design reduces that strain by making options visible and clear.</p>
<h2>Consistency Builds Habits</h2>
<p>Consistency might seem like a small detail, but it is valuable for usability. When buttons look and behave the same across an interface, users form habits. Over time, interaction becomes automatic. Johnson (2014) explains that repeated exposure to consistent patterns helps users learn systems faster. Once something becomes habitual, it requires less conscious effort.</p>
<p>I have noticed this with apps like Instagram or Spotify. The navigation stays in the same place. Icons do not randomly change. Because of that, I no longer think about how to use the app, and the motion is second nature. On the other hand, inconsistency slows everything down. Research by Lyastani et al. (2022) found that inconsistent authentication processes across websites created confusion and friction. That makes sense. If every login process works differently, users have to relearn the flow each time. Consistency reduces the amount of thinking required. Moreover, less thinking (when it is unnecessary) usually means better usability.</p>

<h2>Feedback Prevents Confusion</h2>
<p>Another important part of usability is feedback. When I click a button, I want to know that something happened. If nothing changes, I start to wonder whether the system registered my action. Yablonski (2020) emphasizes that clear system feedback helps reduce uncertainty. Feedback confirms cause and effect. It reassures users that they are on the right track.</p>
<p>A good example is uploading a file. If there is a progress bar or a confirmation message, I feel confident. If I click “upload” and nothing happens, I start clicking again or refreshing the page. That uncertainty increases cognitive load because I am now trying to interpret what the system is doing. Feedback keeps users from guessing. Moreover, when users do not have to guess, usability improves.</p>
<h2>Tesler's Law</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting ideas from The Laws of UX is Tesler’s Law. It states that every system has a certain level of complexity that cannot be removed; it can only be shifted (Yablonski, 2020). Designers cannot eliminate complexity from tasks like booking flights or managing finances. However, they can decide who deals with that complexity: the user or the system. If users have to manually configure everything, remember multiple steps, and interpret unclear instructions, then the complexity may overwhelm some. If the system uses smart defaults, automation, and clear guidance, it absorbs more of that complexity.</p>
<p>For example, when apps auto-fill shipping addresses or securely remember payment information, they reduce effort. The task itself has not become less complex, but the experience feels easier. Tesler’s Law connects directly to cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988). If complexity is unnecessarily placed on the user, it increases mental effort. Good usability means shifting as much of that burden as possible into the design.</p>
<h2>Designs and Cognitive Overload</h2>
<p>I have realized that many frustrating digital experiences stem from unnecessary cognitive load. Some examples I have personally experienced include forms that erase all entered information after one error, navigation menus that move around across pages, and error messages that do not explain what went wrong.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, I have to stop and think harder than I should. That extra effort is not part of my goal — it is caused by the design. Sweller (1988) explains that when working memory is overloaded, performance declines. Johnson (2014) reinforces that interfaces should reduce memory demands wherever possible. When systems ignore these principles, they feel harder to use than they need to be.</p>
<h2>What Makes a System Usable?</h2>
<p>After connecting all these ideas, usability seems less mysterious and more psychological.</p>
<p>A usable system:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>•	Respects working memory limits (Sweller, 1988; Johnson, 2014)</li>
            <li>•	Favors recognition over recall (Johnson, 2014)</li>
            <li>•	Aligns with users’ mental models</li>
            <li>•	Stays consistent to build habits (Johnson, 2014; Lyastani et al., 2022)</li>
            <li>•	Provides clear and timely feedback (Yablonski, 2020)</li>
            <li>•	Manages complexity thoughtfully through Tesler’s Law (Yablonski, 2020)</li>
         </ul>
<p>When these principles come together, interaction feels smooth. We do not notice the design because it does not fight our brain. It works with it.</p>

 <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Before studying these materials, I thought usability was mostly about clean layouts and simple design. Now I see that it is really about cognitive alignment. Digital systems are usable when they match how people actually think, remember, and form habits.</p>
<p>Memory is limited. Attention is limited. Mental shortcuts guide behavior. Good design accepts those limits instead of ignoring them. When designers understand psychology, usability becomes intentional. Moreover, when usability is intentional, digital systems stop feeling like obstacles and start feeling effortless.</p>
